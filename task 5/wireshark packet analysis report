Steps Performed
Opened Wireshark and started a capture on the active network interface.
Generated traffic by browsing a website.
Stopped the capture after ~1 minute.
Applied filters (dns, tcp, http) to view specific protocols.
Identified at least 3 protocols: DNS, TCP, and HTTP/HTTPS.
Exported the capture as a .pcap file.
Summarized findings with packet details.

Findings
DNS: Resolved domain names (e.g., google.com â†’ IP).
TCP: Observed 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK).
HTTP: Captured GET requests and responses from websites.
