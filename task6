Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:

Use 12â€“16+ characters in length.
Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
Avoid dictionary words, personal details (name, DOB), or common patterns (12345, qwerty).
Use random, unique passwords for each account.
Store them securely with a password manager.

Tips Learned from the Evaluation:
Password length is just as important as complexity.
Random placement of symbols/numbers is stronger than predictable ones (e.g., P@ssw0rd! is still weak).
A longer random phrase (passphrase) like Sky!Tree$Ocean2025 can be easier to remember and very secure.
Always enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional protection.

Common Password Attacks:
  Brute Force Attack:
     The attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found.
     Short or simple passwords fall quickly.

  Dictionary Attack:
     Uses a pre-compiled list of common words and passwords.
     Replaces letters with symbols (P@ssw0rd) but still cracks weak dictionary-based passwords.

Summary:
Low complexity + short length = easy to crack in seconds or minutes.
High complexity + long length = takes years or even centuries to break.
Complexity increases resistance against both brute force and dictionary attacks.
Strong, random, and unique passwords greatly reduce the chances of account compromise.
